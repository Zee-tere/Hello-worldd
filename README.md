# Hello-worldd

## An analysis of a dataset containing information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb),including user ratings and revenue. In this data, I will be asking the questions:

- Most popular movies year in year out
- Relationship between budgets and revenues (do movies with higher budgets get higher revenues)
- Are movies with higher budgets more popular
- Are movies with higher vote average more popular?
- Average amount of revenue from 1960-2015
- Name and details of most expensive movie released after 2000
- Comparison of number of movies released per decade
- Highest Revenue generated from movies produced with budget below 150000
- Popularity of movies with votecounts less than 2000
